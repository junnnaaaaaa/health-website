  <h1>Informed Intimacy</h1>
  <h2>Why do we do this?</h2>

  <p>Raising awareness and promoting safe sexual health behaviors among teens aged 15 to 18 is crucial as this age group
    is at a pivotal stage of developing their sexual identities and relationships. Adolescents often lack comprehensive
    sexual health education, making them vulnerable to unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
    and unhealthy relationships. By equipping teens with knowledge and resources, we empower them to make informed
    decisions, fostering healthier futures for themselves and their communities. Moreover, awareness can help reduce
    stigma around sexual health, encouraging open conversations and creating a supportive environment.</p>
