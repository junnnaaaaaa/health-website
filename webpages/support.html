          <h2 style="margin-top: 100px; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 50px;">Comparing Various Support Networks</h2>
          <h3><a href="https://www.1800respect.org.au/">1. 1800RESPECT</a></h3>
          <p>Service: National support service for people experiencing sexual assault, domestic, and family violence.
            Available 24/7, offering confidential phone and online counseling.</p>
          <p>Strengths: Immediate access to professional help, free and confidential. Their website offers extensive
            resources on recognizing abuse and staying safe.</p>
          <p>Critique: While it provides a lifeline for urgent help, the service is reactive rather than proactive. Some
            may find the phone approach daunting, and there's a limit to the depth of help provided without in-person
            follow-up.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.relationships.org.au/">2. Relationships Australia</a></h3>
          <p>Service: Offers counseling, education, and mediation services for people struggling with relationships,
            whether intimate, family, or workplace-related. They provide resources for fostering healthy relationships
            and preventing domestic violence.</p>
          <p>Strengths: Focuses on prevention, offering a mix of workshops, counseling, and educational material to
            promote healthy relationships. It has a long-established reputation in Australia.</p>
          <p>Critique: Services can be expensive without subsidies, and availability of appointments can be an issue in
            some regions. The service focus tends to be more traditional, which may limit its appeal to younger or
            LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://headspace.org.au/"">3. Headspace</a></h3>
    <p>Service: Focuses on mental health and wellbeing for young people (ages 12-25). Provides information and services regarding sexual health, relationships, and consent. Available in-person and via online chat.</p>
    <p>Strengths: Tailored to younger demographics with a clear emphasis on mental and sexual health. It has a modern, youth-friendly approach and reaches individuals at an early stage.</p>
    <p>Critique: Availability in rural areas can be limited. The emphasis on youth can mean it overlooks older adults dealing with similar issues.</p>

    <h3><a href=" https://www.secca.org.au/">4. SECCA</a></h3>
          <p>Service: SECCA offers sexual education resources, particularly tailored for people with disabilities. They

            consent.</p>
          <p>Strengths: SECCA is unique in offering resources that cater specifically to people with disabilities,
            ensuring inclusivity in sexual health education. Their tools are user-friendly and accessible.</p>
