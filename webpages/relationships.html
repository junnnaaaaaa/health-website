  <h2>What are some signs of an unhealthy relationship?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Lack of communication:</b> Communication breakdowns, misunderstandings, and conflicts that are left unresolved can indicate an unhealthy relationship. When partners are unable to express their thoughts, feelings, and needs openly and honestly, or listen to each other with empathy and understanding, it can lead to resentment, frustration, and disconnection.</li>
    <li><b>Trust issues:</b> Distrust, suspicion, and jealousy can erode the foundation of a healthy relationship and create tension, insecurity, and anxiety between partners. When there is a lack of trust, partners may feel guarded, defensive, or paranoid, and struggle to feel secure, valued, and respected in the relationship.</li>
    <li><b>Disrespectful behavior:</b> Disrespectful, demeaning, or abusive behavior towards a partner can indicate an unhealthy relationship. When partners belittle, criticize, or undermine each other, or violate each other's boundaries, autonomy, or dignity, it can lead to emotional pain, trauma, and harm.</li>
    <li><b>Lack of empathy:</b> Lack of empathy, compassion, or support towards a partner's feelings, experiences, or concerns can indicate an unhealthy relationship. When partners are unable to understand, validate, or respond to each other's emotions, it can create distance, isolation, and disconnection in the relationship.</li>
    <li><b>Power imbalances:</b> Power struggles, control issues, or inequality in a relationship can indicate an unhealthy dynamic. When one partner dominates, manipulates, or exploits the other, or uses coercion, intimidation, or force to get their way, it can lead to feelings of powerlessness, helplessness, and resentment.</li>
